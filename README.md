# 🌫️ ELKAformer Image Dehazing System

A Transformer-based single image dehazing system implemented using PyTorch and the ELKAformer architecture.  
This project focuses on restoring clear images from haze-degraded inputs using an end-to-end deep learning pipeline.

## Overview

This project implements a high-quality image dehazing solution using a transformer-based restoration model.  
It learns a mapping between hazy images and their corresponding ground-truth clear images and produces visually sharp and structurally accurate results.

Key features:
- Single-image atmospheric haze removal
- Transformer-based ELKAformer architecture
- Complete training, testing, evaluation, and visualization pipeline
- Quantitative evaluation using PSNR and SSIM
